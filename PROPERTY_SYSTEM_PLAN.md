# Property System Implementation Plan

## Current Status
Properties can be added through the admin panel, but we need to ensure they:
1. Display properly on the admin properties page
2. Show on the public website homepage (featured properties)
3. Show on the public properties listing page
4. Have proper detail pages

## Tasks

### 1. Admin Properties Page ✅ (Already exists)
- Location: `frontend/src/app/admin/properties/page.tsx`
- Features: List, add, edit, delete properties
- Status: Need to verify it's fetching real data

### 2. Public Homepage - Featured Properties
- Location: `frontend/src/app/components/FeaturedProperties.tsx`
- Should show: 3-6 featured properties
- Criteria: Properties marked as `isFeatured: true`
- Status: Need to verify

### 3. Public Properties Listing Page
- Location: `frontend/src/app/properties/page.tsx`
- Should show: All active properties with filters
- Features: Search, filter by location/type/price
- Status: Need to verify

### 4. Property Detail Page
- Location: `frontend/src/app/properties/[id]/page.tsx`
- Should show: Full property details, images, contact form
- Status: Need to verify

## Implementation Steps

1. ✅ Check admin properties page - ensure real data
2. ✅ Check featured properties on homepage
3. ✅ Check properties listing page
4. ✅ Check property detail page
5. ✅ Ensure all use real database data
6. ✅ Add skeleton loaders
7. ✅ Make mobile responsive
8. ✅ Professional styling

## Database Schema Check

Properties should have:
- `isFeatured: Boolean` - for homepage display
- `status: String` - active/inactive
- `images: String[]` - property images
- All other property details

## Next Steps
1. Verify each page one by one
2. Fix any issues with data fetching
3. Add skeleton loaders
4. Ensure mobile responsiveness
5. Professional styling throughout
