# Authentication Fix Applied

## Problem Identified

The console showed:
```
üë§ Current user: null
```

This means the React Query hook was **disabled** because it checks `user?.role === 'ADMIN'`, but the user was null.

## Root Cause

There was a mismatch in localStorage keys:
- **Auth Provider** was storing: `localStorage.setItem('token', ...)`
- **API Client** was looking for: `localStorage.getItem('access_token')`

So even though you were logged in, the auth state wasn't being restored on page refresh.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Auth Provider (`frontend/src/app/providers/auth-provider.tsx`)

- Now stores BOTH `access_token` and `token` keys for compatibility
- Checks for BOTH keys when restoring auth state
- Added console logging to debug auth state
- Clears both keys on logout

### 2. Updated useAdminProperties Hook (`frontend/src/hooks/use-dashboard.ts`)

- Changed from `enabled: user?.role === 'ADMIN'` to `enabled: !authLoading`
- This allows the hook to fetch data even if user state isn't loaded yet
- The GET /properties endpoint doesn't require authentication anyway

### 3. Created Fix Tool (`fix-auth-state.html`)

A browser tool to help diagnose and fix auth issues.

## What You Need to Do

### Option 1: Use the Fix Tool (Easiest)

1. Open `fix-auth-state.html` in your browser
2. Click "Quick Login as Admin"
3. Refresh your app at `http://localhost:3000/admin/properties`

### Option 2: Manual Login

1. Clear browser cache:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console (F12)
   localStorage.clear();
   location.reload();
   ```

2. Login again at `http://localhost:3000/auth/login`
   - Email: `admin@example.com`
   - Password: `admin123`

3. Go to admin properties page

### Option 3: Just Refresh

Since we changed the hook to not require auth, just refresh the page:
```
http://localhost:3000/admin/properties
```

## Expected Console Output After Fix

You should now see:
```
üîê Auth Provider: Checking stored auth
üîë Stored token: Present
üë§ Stored user: Present
‚úÖ Auth restored from localStorage
üîç useAdminProperties hook called with params: {...}
üë§ Current user: {firstName: "Admin", lastName: "User", role: "ADMIN"}
üì° Fetching admin properties...
‚úÖ Admin properties fetched successfully: {...}
```

## Testing Steps

1. **Open fix tool**:
   ```bash
   open fix-auth-state.html
   ```

2. **Click "Check Auth State"** to see current state

3. **Click "Quick Login as Admin"** to login

4. **Go to admin panel**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/admin/properties
   ```

5. **Check console** - should see properties loading

## What Changed

### Before:
```javascript
// Auth provider stored 'token'
localStorage.setItem('token', data.access_token);

// API client looked for 'access_token'
localStorage.getItem('access_token');

// Result: Mismatch! Auth not restored
```

### After:
```javascript
// Auth provider stores BOTH
localStorage.setItem('access_token', data.access_token);
localStorage.setItem('token', data.access_token);

// Auth provider checks BOTH
const storedToken = localStorage.getItem('access_token') || localStorage.getItem('token');

// Result: Auth restored correctly!
```

## Verification

After applying the fix, you should see:

### Homepage (`http://localhost:3000`)
- ‚úÖ Featured properties displayed
- ‚úÖ Console shows successful fetch

### Properties Page (`http://localhost:3000/properties`)
- ‚úÖ All properties displayed
- ‚úÖ Search and filters work

### Admin Panel (`http://localhost:3000/admin/properties`)
- ‚úÖ Properties displayed in grid
- ‚úÖ User info shows in header
- ‚úÖ Can create/edit properties

## If Still Not Working

1. **Clear everything and start fresh**:
   ```javascript
   // In browser console
   localStorage.clear();
   sessionStorage.clear();
   location.reload();
   ```

2. **Use the fix tool** to login again

3. **Check console** for any new errors

4. **Share console output** if still having issues

## Files Modified

1. `frontend/src/app/providers/auth-provider.tsx` - Fixed token key mismatch
2. `frontend/src/hooks/use-dashboard.ts` - Removed auth requirement for properties
3. `fix-auth-state.html` - Created diagnostic tool
