## üîß Technical Implementation

### Email Service Architecture

```typescript
// Email Service Structure
EmailService
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sendRealtorInvitation()     // Invitation emails
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sendWelcomeEmail()          // Welcome emails
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ getRealtorInvitationTemplate()
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ getWelcomeTemplate()
```

### Integration Points

1. **Realtor Invitation Controller**
   - `POST /admin/realtors/invite` - Sends invitation email
   - `POST /admin/realtors/invitations/:id/resend` - Resends invitation

2. **Realtor Registration**
   - `POST /auth/realtor-invitation/:token/accept` - Sends welcome email

3. **Lead Creation**
   - `POST /leads` - Sends notification email to assigned realtor

### Error Handling

```typescript
// Email sending with error handling
try {
  const emailSent = await this.emailService.sendRealtorInvitation(
    email, firstName, lastName, token
  );
  
  if (!emailSent) {
    throw new BadRequestException('Failed to send invitation email');
  }
} catch (error) {
  this.logger.error('Email sending failed:', error);
  // Handle gracefully - don't fail the entire operation
}
```

## üìà Monitoring and Analytics

### Resend Dashboard
- Email delivery status
- Open rates and click rates
- Bounce and complaint rates
- Domain reputation
- API usage statistics

### Application Logging
```typescript
// Email service includes comprehensive logging
this.logger.log(`Invitation email sent to ${email}. Message ID: ${data?.id}`);
this.logger.error('Failed to send email:', error);
```

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- Email delivery rate (should be >95%)
- Invitation acceptance rate
- Email open rates
- Click-through rates on invitation links
- Lead notification response times

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Email Not Received
**Symptoms**: User doesn't receive invitation email
**Solutions**:
- Check spam/junk folder
- Verify email address is correct
- Check Resend dashboard for delivery status
- Verify domain DNS settings
- Check API key validity

#### 2. Invalid API Key
**Symptoms**: `RESEND_API_KEY not found` or authentication errors
**Solutions**:
- Verify API key is set in environment variables
- Check API key format (should start with `re_`)
- Regenerate API key in Resend dashboard
- Restart application after updating environment

#### 3. Domain Not Verified
**Symptoms**: Emails sent from `resend.dev` instead of custom domain
**Solutions**:
- Complete domain verification in Resend
- Add required DNS records
- Wait for propagation (up to 24 hours)
- Update FROM_EMAIL environment variable

#### 4. Template Rendering Issues
**Symptoms**: Broken email formatting or missing content
**Solutions**:
- Check HTML template syntax
- Verify all variables are properly substituted
- Test with different email clients
- Check responsive design on mobile

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check environment variables
echo $RESEND_API_KEY
echo $FROM_EMAIL
echo $FRONTEND_URL

# Test email service directly
node -e "
const { EmailService } = require('./dist/email/email.service');
const service = new EmailService();
console.log('Email service initialized:', !!service);
"

# Check database for invitations
npx prisma studio
# Navigate to RealtorInvitation table
```

### Log Analysis

```bash
# Check application logs for email-related errors
grep -i "email" logs/application.log
grep -i "resend" logs/application.log
grep -i "invitation" logs/application.log
```
