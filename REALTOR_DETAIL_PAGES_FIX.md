# Realtor Detail Pages Fix - Real Data Implementation

## 🎯 Problem
The admin dashboard's view and edit realtor pages were displaying mock/dummy data instead of fetching actual realtor information from the database.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Backend Changes

#### 1. Admin Controller (`backend/src/admin/admin.controller.ts`)
Added new endpoints for realtor management:
- `PUT /admin/realtors/:id` - Update realtor details
- `DELETE /admin/realtors/:id` - Delete realtor
- `PUT /admin/realtors/:id/status` - Toggle realtor active status

#### 2. Admin Service (`backend/src/admin/admin.service.ts`)
Added new methods:
- `updateRealtor(id, data)` - Updates realtor and user information
- `deleteRealtor(id)` - Deletes realtor (cascades to user)
- `updateRealtorStatus(id, isActive)` - Toggles realtor active/inactive status

### Frontend Changes

#### 1. New Hook (`frontend/src/hooks/use-realtor-detail.ts`)
Created a custom hook for managing individual realtor data:
- `useRealtorDetail(id)` - Fetches realtor details by ID
- `updateRealtor(data)` - Updates realtor information
- Handles loading and error states
- Provides refetch functionality

#### 2. View Realtor Page (`frontend/src/app/admin/realtors/[id]/page.tsx`)
**Before:** Displayed hardcoded dummy data
**After:** 
- Fetches real realtor data using `useRealtorDetail` hook
- Displays actual user information (name, email, phone, address)
- Shows real bank account details
- Calculates real performance metrics from leads and commissions
- Displays actual property, lead, and commission counts
- Shows correct active/inactive status
- Generates proper referral link

#### 3. Edit Realtor Page (`frontend/src/app/admin/realtors/edit/[id]/page.tsx`)
**Before:** Displayed hardcoded form with dummy data
**After:**
- Fetches real realtor data on page load
- Pre-fills form with actual realtor information
- Saves updates to the database via API
- Handles loading and error states
- Redirects to view page after successful save
- Split full name into firstName and lastName fields
- Removed temporary password field (not needed for edits)

## 🔄 Data Flow

### View Page
```
User visits /admin/realtors/[id]
  ↓
useRealtorDetail hook fetches data
  ↓
GET /admin/realtors/:id
  ↓
Display real realtor information
```

### Edit Page
```
User visits /admin/realtors/edit/[id]
  ↓
useRealtorDetail hook fetches data
  ↓
Form pre-filled with real data
  ↓
User makes changes and clicks Save
  ↓
PUT /admin/realtors/:id
  ↓
Redirect to view page
```

## 📊 Real Data Displayed

### View Page Shows:
- ✅ Full name (from user.firstName + user.lastName)

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test script to verify the implementation:
```bash
node test-realtor-detail-pages.js
```

The test will:
1. Login as admin
2. Fetch all realtors
3. Get detailed information for first realtor
4. Update realtor information
5. Toggle realtor status
6. Verify the updates

## 🌐 Frontend URLs

After running the test, you can visit:
- **View Page:** `http://localhost:3000/admin/realtors/[realtor-id]`
- **Edit Page:** `http://localhost:3000/admin/realtors/edit/[realtor-id]`

## 🔒 Security

All endpoints are protected with:
- JWT authentication (`@UseGuards(JwtAuthGuard)`)
- Role-based access control (`@Roles('ADMIN')`)
- Only admins can view and edit realtor details

## ✨ Features

### Loading States
- Shows spinner while fetching data
- Displays "Loading realtor details..." message

### Error Handling
- Shows error message if fetch fails
- Provides "Back to Realtors" button
- Toast notifications for success/error

### Form Validation
- Disabled save button while saving
- Shows "Saving..." text during update
- Redirects after successful save

## 📝 Notes

- The view page still uses dummy chart data for the "Views Overview" graph (can be enhanced later with real analytics)
- Profile image upload functionality can be added later (currently accepts URL)
- Password reset should be handled through a separate flow (not in edit page)
- All monetary values are displayed in Naira (₦)

## 🚀 Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add real analytics data for the views chart
2. Implement profile image upload with Cloudinary
3. Add password reset functionality
4. Add delete confirmation modal
5. Add audit log for realtor changes
6. Add export functionality for realtor data
7. Add bulk actions (activate/deactivate multiple realtors)

## 🎛️ Status Toggle Feature

Added the ability to activate/deactivate realtors directly from the admin interface:

### View Page
- Shows current status with color indicator (green = active, red = inactive)
- "Activate" or "Deactivate" button based on current status
- Button changes color (green for activate, yellow for deactivate)
- Shows "Updating..." while processing

### Edit Page
- Dedicated "Account Status" section
- Visual status indicator with colored dot
- "Activate Account" or "Deactivate Account" button
- Status updates immediately without page reload

### API Endpoint
- `PUT /admin/realtors/:id/status` with `{ isActive: boolean }`
- Updates the user's isActive field
- Returns updated realtor data

### Testing
Run the status toggle test:
```bash
node test-realtor-status-toggle.js
```

This will:
1. Get a realtor's current status
2. Toggle it to the opposite state
3. Verify the change
4. Toggle it back to original
5. Confirm everything works

## ✅ Status

**COMPLETE** - Both view and edit pages now:
- ✅ Fetch and display real realtor data from the database
- ✅ Allow editing realtor information
- ✅ Support activating/deactivating realtor accounts
- ✅ Show real-time status updates
