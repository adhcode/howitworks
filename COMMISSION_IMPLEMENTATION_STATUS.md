# Commission System Implementation - Status

## âœ… Phase 1: Database Schema (COMPLETE)

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Property Model
```prisma
âœ… Added commissionRate (Float, default 3.0)
âœ… Added commissionType (String, default "percentage")
```

#### 2. Lead Model
```prisma
âœ… Added commissions relation (Commission[])
```

#### 3. Commission Model
```prisma
âœ… Added leadId (String?)
âœ… Added notes (String?)
âœ… Added lead relation (Lead?)
```

### Migration Required:
```bash
cd backend
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_commission_system
npx prisma generate
```

## âœ… Phase 2: Backend Logic (COMPLETE)

### Auto-Commission Creation

#### Trigger: Lead Status â†’ "converted"
```typescript
âœ… Detects when lead is marked as converted
âœ… Checks if realtor and property exist
âœ… Calculates commission based on property settings
âœ… Creates commission record automatically
âœ… Logs all actions for debugging
```

#### Commission Calculation Logic
```typescript
âœ… Percentage: price Ã— (rate / 100)
âœ… Fixed: returns rate as-is
âœ… Default rate: 3%
```

#### Features:
- âœ… Automatic commission creation
- âœ… Smart calculation (percentage or fixed)
- âœ… Error handling (doesn't block lead update)
- âœ… Detailed logging
- âœ… Links commission to lead

### Example Flow:

```
Lead #123 â†’ Status: "converted"
        â†“
Property: â‚¦50,000,000 (3% commission)
        â†“
Calculate: â‚¦50M Ã— 3% = â‚¦1,500,000
        â†“
Create Commission:
  - Client: John Doe
  - Amount: â‚¦1,500,000
  - Status: pending
  - Realtor: Jane Smith
  - Property: Luxury Villa
  - Lead: #123
        â†“
âœ… Commission #456 created
```

## ðŸ”„ Phase 3: Admin UI (IN PROGRESS)

### To Do:
- [ ] Add commission fields to property creation form
- [ ] Add commission fields to property edit form
- [ ] Create admin commission management page
- [ ] Add commission approval/rejection
- [ ] Add commission payout marking
- [ ] Add commission statistics

## ðŸ”„ Phase 4: Realtor UI (PENDING)

### To Do:
- [ ] Update realtor dashboard with earnings
- [ ] Show total earnings
- [ ] Show pending commissions
- [ ] Create commission history page
- [ ] Add commission details view

## How It Works Now

### 1. Property Setup
```
Admin creates property:
  - Price: â‚¦50,000,000
  - Commission Rate: 3.0
  - Commission Type: percentage
```

### 2. Lead Conversion
```
User enquires â†’ Lead created
Admin marks lead as "converted"
```

### 3. Automatic Commission
```
System automatically:
  1. Detects conversion
  2. Calculates: â‚¦50M Ã— 3% = â‚¦1.5M
  3. Creates commission record
  4. Status: pending
  5. Assigns to realtor
```

### 4. Admin Approval
```
Admin reviews commission
Admin approves
Admin marks as paid
```

### 5. Realtor Sees Earnings
```
Realtor dashboard shows:
  - Total Earnings: â‚¦1,500,000
  - Status: Paid
```

## Commission Status Flow

```
pending â†’ approved â†’ paid
   â†“         â†“
rejected  rejected
```

- **pending**: Auto-created, awaiting admin review
- **approved**: Admin verified and approved
- **paid**: Admin marked as paid to realtor
- **rejected**: Admin rejected (with notes)
