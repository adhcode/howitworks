### For Better Display:

1. **Ensure Properties Have Images**
   - Upload at least 1 image per property
   - Images stored in Cloudinary
   - URLs saved in database

2. **Mark Some as Featured**
   - Set `isFeatured: true` for 3-6 properties
   - These will show on homepage

3. **Set Proper Status**
   - Use `status: 'active'` for visible properties
   - Use `status: 'inactive'` to hide

4. **Assign Realtors**
   - Each property should have a `realtorId`
   - Links property to realtor for leads
