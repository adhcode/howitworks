# Commission System - Complete Implementation ✅

## Overview
Full commission tracking system for realtors with automatic commission creation when leads convert to sales.

## What's Been Built

### Phase 1: Database Schema ✅
**Property Model** - Added commission fields:
- `commissionRate` (default 3%)
- `commissionType` ("percentage" or "fixed")

**Lead Model** - Added:
- `commissions` relation

**Commission Model** - Enhanced:
- `leadId` (link to lead)
- `notes` (admin notes)

### Phase 2: Backend Logic ✅
**Automatic Commission Creation:**
- Lead Status → "converted"
- System automatically:
  1. Detects conversion ✅
  2. Gets property price & commission rate ✅
  3. Calculates commission ✅
  4. Creates commission record ✅
  5. Links to lead & realtor ✅
  6. Logs everything ✅

**Calculation Logic:**
- Percentage: ₦50M × 3% = ₦1.5M ✅
- Fixed: Returns fixed amount ✅

**Backend Endpoints:**
- `GET /admin/commissions` - List all commissions
- `PUT /admin/commissions/:id/status` - Update commission status

### Phase 3: Property Form Updates ✅
**Added Commission Fields:**
- Commission Type selector (percentage/fixed)
- Commission Rate/Amount input
- Real-time commission calculation preview
- Shows estimated commission based on property price

**Location:** `frontend/src/app/admin/components/CreatePropertyModal.tsx`

### Phase 4: Admin Commission Management Page ✅
**Features:**
- Beautiful dashboard with stats cards
- Total commissions, pending, approved, paid counts
- Total amount and pending amount tracking
- Filter by status (all, pending, approved, paid, rejected)
- Comprehensive commission table with:
  - Realtor information
  - Property details
  - Commission amount
  - Status badges
  - Action buttons
- Status management:
  - Approve pending commissions
  - Reject pending commissions
  - Mark approved commissions as paid

**Location:** `frontend/src/app/admin/commissions/page.tsx`

### Phase 5: Hooks & API Integration ✅
**Commission Hook:**
- `useCommissions()` - Fetch and manage commissions
- `updateCommissionStatus()` - Update commission status
- Auto-refresh after updates

**Location:** `frontend/src/hooks/use-commissions.ts`

## How It Works

### Example Flow:
1. **Admin creates property:**
   - Price: ₦50,000,000
   - Commission: 3% (percentage)
   - Estimated commission: ₦1,500,000

2. **User enquires:**
   - Lead created with status "new"
   - Linked to property and realtor (if via referral)

3. **Admin marks lead as "converted":**
   - System automatically creates commission:
     - Amount: ₦1,500,000
     - Status: Pending
     - Realtor: Assigned
     - Lead: Linked

4. **Admin reviews commission:**
   - Views in `/admin/commissions`
   - Can approve or reject

5. **Admin approves:**
   - Status changes to "approved"
   - Ready for payout

6. **Admin marks as paid:**
   - Status changes to "paid"
   - Realtor sees in their earnings

## Testing

### Run the test script:
```bash
node test-commission-system.js
```

### Test Flow:
1. Creates property with 3% commission
2. Creates lead for that property
3. Converts lead to sale
4. Verifies commission auto-creation
5. Approves commission
6. Marks as paid
7. Verifies final status
