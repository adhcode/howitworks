# Enquiry System Implementation - Phase 1 & 2 Complete

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Frontend Form Update (COMPLETE)

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Removed Manual "Realtor Referral ID" Field
- ‚ùå Removed the confusing manual input field
- ‚úÖ System now automatically tracks realtors via URL parameters
- ‚úÖ Cleaner, simpler form for users

#### 2. Updated Form Interface
```typescript
// BEFORE
interface InquiryForm {
    realtorId: string;  // ‚ùå Manual input
    // ...
}

// AFTER
interface InquiryForm {
    // ‚ùå realtorId removed
    // System automatically tracks via localStorage
}
```

#### 3. Enhanced Lead Submission Logic
```typescript
const leadData = {
    name: `${formData.firstName} ${formData.lastName}`,
    email: formData.email,
    phone: formData.phone,
    message: `${formData.message}${formData.preferredDate ? `\n\nPreferred viewing date: ${formData.preferredDate}` : ''}`,
    propertyId: property.id,
    realtorSlug: referralCode || undefined, // Automatic tracking
    source: referralCode ? 'referral_link' : (property.realtor ? 'property_listing' : 'direct_inquiry')
};
```

#### 4. Added Referral Indicator
Users now see a friendly message when they came via a realtor's referral link:
```
‚úì You're being assisted by one of our verified realtors
```

#### 5. Improved Source Tracking
- `referral_link` - User came via ?ref=realtor-slug
- `property_listing` - Property has an assigned realtor
- `direct_inquiry` - No realtor involved

## ‚úÖ Phase 2: Backend Enhancement (COMPLETE)

### Changes Made:

#### 1. Enhanced Realtor Assignment Priority
```typescript
// Priority 1: Referral link (highest priority)
if (realtorSlug) ‚Üí Assign to that realtor

// Priority 2: Direct realtor ID
if (realtorId) ‚Üí Assign to that realtor

// Priority 3: Property's realtor
if (property.realtorId) ‚Üí Assign to property's realtor

// Priority 4: No assignment
Leave as null ‚Üí Admin assigns later
```

#### 2. Added Logging
Backend now logs realtor assignment for debugging:
```
‚úÖ Lead assigned to realtor via referral link: john-doe
‚úÖ Lead assigned to realtor via ID: abc-123
‚úÖ Lead assigned to property's realtor: xyz-789
‚ÑπÔ∏è Lead created without realtor assignment - will be assigned by admin
```

#### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Gracefully handles missing realtors
- Doesn't fail if realtor not found
- Allows admin to assign later

## How It Works Now

### User Journey:

#### Scenario 1: Referral Link
```
1. User clicks: https://site.com?ref=john-doe
2. ReferralTracker stores "john-doe" in localStorage
3. User browses properties
4. User submits inquiry on any property
5. System automatically assigns lead to John Doe
6. Referral code cleared after submission
```

#### Scenario 2: Property with Realtor
```
1. User visits property directly (no ref parameter)
2. Property is listed by Jane Smith
3. User submits inquiry
4. System automatically assigns lead to Jane Smith
```

#### Scenario 3: Direct Inquiry
```
1. User visits property directly (no ref parameter)
2. Property has no assigned realtor
3. User submits inquiry
4. Lead created without realtor
5. Admin can assign realtor later in admin panel
```
