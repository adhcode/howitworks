# Property Listing Type Feature

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Update
Added `listingType` field to Property model:
```prisma
model Property {
  ...
  listingType  String  @default("sale") // sale, rent, investment
  ...
}
```

### 2. Frontend - Create Property Modal
Added listing type selector with 3 options:
- **For Sale** - Properties available for purchase
- **For Rent** - Properties available for rental
- **For Investment** - Properties available for fractional investment

### 3. Listing Type Options

#### Sale
- Traditional property purchase
- Full ownership transfer
- One-time payment or mortgage

#### Rent
- Monthly/yearly rental
- Tenant occupancy
- Lease agreements

#### Investment
- Fractional ownership
- Investment returns
- Shared ownership model

## 🔧 Migration Required

Run this command to update the database:
```bash
cd backend
npx prisma migrate dev --name add_listing_type
npx prisma generate
```

## 🧪 Testing Properties

### Debug Script
Run this to check if properties are in the database:
```bash
node test-properties-debug.js
```

This will:
1. Login as admin
2. Check existing properties
3. Create a test property if none exist
4. Verify the property was created

### Manual Testing
1. Go to `/admin/properties`
2. Click "Add Property"
3. Fill in all fields including the new "Listing Type"
4. Upload at least one image
5. Save the property
6. Check if it appears in the list

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Properties Not Showing?

**Check 1: Database Connection**
- Ensure backend is running
- Check DATABASE_URL in backend/.env

**Check 2: API Endpoints**
- Open browser console
- Check Network tab for failed requests
- Look for 401 (auth) or 500 (server) errors

**Check 3: Property Status**
- Properties must have `status: 'active'` to show
- Check database directly if needed

**Check 4: Frontend Hooks**
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify API calls are being made
- Check if data is being received

### Common Issues:

1. **No properties in database**
   - Run test-properties-debug.js to create test data
   - Or manually add via admin panel

2. **Properties exist but don't show**
   - Check if status is 'active'
   - Check if API endpoint is correct
   - Check browser console for errors

3. **Images not showing**
   - Verify Cloudinary is configured
   - Check CLOUDINARY_* env variables
   - Ensure images array is not empty

## 📝 Next Steps

1. ✅ Run migration to add listingType field
2. ✅ Restart backend server
3. ✅ Test creating a property with listing type
4. ✅ Verify property shows on admin panel
5. ✅ Verify featured properties show on homepage
6. ✅ Add filters for listing type on properties page

## 🎨 UI Display

Properties will now show their listing type:
- **Sale**: "For Sale" badge (Green)
- **Rent**: "For Rent" badge (Blue)
- **Investment**: "For Investment" badge (Purple)

This helps users quickly identify what type of property listing they're viewing.
