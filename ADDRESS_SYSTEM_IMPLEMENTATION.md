## 📊 Technical Implementation

### Component Structure
```typescript
AddressInput
├── Street Address Input
├── State Dropdown (with search)
├── City Input (with suggestions)
├── Auto-generated Postal Code
├── Country (fixed to Nigeria)
└── Full Address Preview
```

### State Management
```typescript
const [formData, setFormData] = useState<AddressData>({
  street: '',
  city: '',
  state: '',
  zipCode: '',
  country: 'Nigeria',
  fullAddress: ''
});
```

### Auto-complete Logic
```typescript
// State filtering
const filtered = Object.keys(NIGERIAN_STATES).filter(state =>
  state.toLowerCase().includes(value.toLowerCase())
);

// City suggestions
const stateCities = NIGERIAN_STATES[selectedState] || [];
const filtered = stateCities.filter(city =>
  city.toLowerCase().includes(value.toLowerCase())
);
```

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Basic Usage
```tsx
import AddressInput from '@/components/AddressInput';

function MyForm() {
  const [address, setAddress] = useState(null);
  
  return (
    <AddressInput
      label="Your Address"
      value={address}
      onChange={setAddress}
      required
    />
  );
}
```

### With Form Integration
```tsx
const handleAddressChange = (address: AddressData) => {
  setFormData(prev => ({
    ...prev,
    residentialAddress: address
  }));
};

<AddressInput
  label="Residential Address"
  value={formData.residentialAddress}
  onChange={handleAddressChange}
  placeholder="Enter your residential address"
  required
/>
```

### Validation
```typescript
const validateForm = () => {
  if (!formData.residentialAddress.fullAddress.trim()) {
    toast.error('Residential address is required');
    return false;
  }
  return true;
};
```
